# MOSS
MOSS is a conversational language model like ChatGPT.

Code and model checkpoints will be publicly available in March 2023.

## Update

### 2023/3/5

- Currently MOSS is only accessible inside the Fudan University and unavailable to the public.

- We are pushing forward to host a demo on huggingface.

- We are developing a new version of MOSS (ver: 0.0.3), which would be better at Chinese understanding and generation, and be augmented with a large number of external tools.
