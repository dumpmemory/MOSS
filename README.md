# MOSS
MOSS is a conversational language model like ChatGPT.

Code and model checkpoints will be publicly available in March 2023.

## Update

### 2023/3/30

- We are tuning the new version of MOSS (v0.0.3). The code, checkpoints (including the base model, SFT model, preference model, and the final model), and technical report will be released in April. 我们正在努力优化MOSS，相关代码、模型参数（包括基座模型、SFT模型、偏好模型、最终对话模型）、技术报告将推迟至四月份统一公开。

### 2023/3/5

- Currently MOSS is only accessible inside the Fudan University and unavailable to the public.

- We are pushing forward to host a demo on huggingface.

- We are developing a new version of MOSS (ver: 0.0.3), which would be better at Chinese understanding and generation, and be augmented with a large number of external tools such as search engine.
